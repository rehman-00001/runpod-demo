divya, adult woman, long black straight hair, dark brown eyes, arched eyebrows, oval face with soft jawline, a broad nose with a rounded tip, full lips, warm medium-brown skin, an athletic build with broad shoulders and defined arms, full-body shot, standing confidently with a gentle smile, holding a paintbrush in one hand and a colorful artist’s palette in the other, hair pulled back into a low ponytail, wearing a form-fitting black sleeveless crop top with a deep V-neckline and a matching high-waisted pencil skirt, in a bright, minimalist art studio with large windows, an easel displaying a landscape painting, a potted fiddle-leaf fig plant, and a small globe on a side table, under soft natural light from the window.
